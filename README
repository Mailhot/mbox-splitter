MBOX-SPLITTER

	Splits an mbox file into chunks of a given size.
	Taken from  zyxwu/mbox-splitter, improved speed and made usable for large .mbox files (tested with 27 gigs)

	This program simply reads file in bytes chunks of 5 mb (editable), 
	it then split the chunks into message based on the '\nFrom ' string,
	then write the messages to an output file, summing bytes counts for each message along the way.
	When the "size" setting is attained it will close the file and create a new one and keep going.


Usage
	python mbox-splitter.py filename size

Arguments:
	1) filename: Mbox archive to split.
	2) size: a positive integer value of chunk size, in Mb


Example
	python mbox-splitter.py inbox_test.mbox 50

Result
	Created file `inbox_test_1.mbox`, size=43Mb, messages=35
	Created file `inbox_test_2.mbox`, size=44Mb, messages=2
	Created file `inbox_test_3.mbox`, size=30Mb, messages=73
	Done

IMPROVEMENT
	Clean the code, this was a "dirty" quick solution.
